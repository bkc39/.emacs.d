# .emacs.d
Landscape for my zen garden.

Depends on `use-package` and `straight.el`. The automatic install
requires an internet connection. Your first time starting emacs will
take a while because it will install everything that first go. After
that it'll be buttery, though.

I use this on MacOS and Ubuntu mostly.
